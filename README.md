## Development Log

### Day 1 - Scoping, Design & Decision Making

#### Decision Making and Scoping

- Decided on static site hosted on Github Pages making use of 3rd party services such as mailchimp and go daddy for routing and email subscription handling
- Main reason for this is to keep costs as low as possible. Due to the scope of the website anything else would probably be a bit overkill.
- "Backend" is more likely just going to be a script calling json files from a repository.
- This will keep the project very cost effective.

* Noted possible issues - browser caching - will need to figure out a way to make this still work (version number files?).

#### Design

- Spoke to Mum, will use simple web design for easy navigation.
- Will use good contrasting colour palette

#### Familiarisation

- Added some files to test how GitHub pages works. Many thanks to Stack Overflow for providing this info.

#### Progress Made

- Created boilerplate elements such as the navbar in html.
- Resized image assets that will be used.
- Spoken to Mum about what information we need and created a mock design for the homepage.
- Set up a mailchimp account to manage newsletter.
- Added Social Media Links to page.
- Added necessary files that will be added to in time such as the stylesheet and robots file.
