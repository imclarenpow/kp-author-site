## Development Log

### Day 1 - Scoping, Design & Decision Making

#### Decision Making and Scoping

- Decided on static site hosted on Github Pages making use of 3rd party services such as mailchimp and go daddy for routing and email subscription handling
- Main reason for this is to keep costs as low as possible. Due to the scope of the website anything else would probably be a bit overkill.
- "Backend" is more likely just going to be a script calling json files from a repository.
- This will keep the project very cost effective.

* Noted possible issues - browser caching - will need to figure out a way to make this still work (version number files?).

#### Design

- Next - will have conversation around this with client (Mum lol).

#### Familiarisation

- Added some files to test how GitHub pages works. Many thanks to Stack Overflow for providing this info.
